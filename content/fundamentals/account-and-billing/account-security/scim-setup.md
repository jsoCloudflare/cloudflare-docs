# Provision Cloudflare with SCIM

By connecting a System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provider, you can provision access to the Cloudflare dashboard on a per-user basis, mastered from your IDP.

Currently, we only provide SCIM support for Enterprise customers, and only from Microsoft Entra and Okta.
In order to get this set up, reach out to your account team, and ask for 

## Limitations

- If a user is the only Super Administrator on an Enterprise account, they will not be deprovisioned.
- We do not currently support Domain Scoped Roles provisioning via SCIM, only account-scoped roles. We are working on this limitation
- We do not currently allow custom group names, in order to leave space for future development

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare provisioning with SCIM is only available to Enterprise customers and requires a Cloudflare-specific feature flag. Contact your account team for more information.
- In Cloudflare, [Super Administrator](/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/roles/) access on the account 
- In your IDP, the ability to create applications, as well as groups
